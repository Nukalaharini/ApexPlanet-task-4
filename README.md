# ApexPlanet-task-4 Security Enhancement in PHP & MySQL Project

As part of my ongoing internship project, Iâ€™ve successfully completed Task 4: Security Enhancement. After securing all database interactions with prepared statements in the previous task, this phase focused on strengthening the overall security of the application.

# Key improvements:

- Implemented input validation and output sanitization to prevent XSS attacks.
- Secured user authentication with hashed passwords using password_hash() and password_verify().
- Enhanced session security with session regeneration and proper handling of session data.
- Introduced secure login and registration mechanisms using prepared statements to eliminate SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- Added a logout system to ensure safe session termination.


This task significantly improved the robustness and security of the application, making it more resilient against common web vulnerabilities.
